1. **Liberzon, A**. and Gurka, R.b, 2011, High sensitivity flexible blade rheometer. 

The innovation is a low-cost flexible extension to the standard off-the-shelf rotational blade rheometer. State of the art rotational rheometer use fixed and rigid blades, which rotate against a fluid and have limited accuracy at extremely high or low viscosities. Our inventions replaces the rigid blades with flexible blades work by utilizing fluid mechanics and fluid-blade interaction principles and allow to detect small changes of viscosity. The very small viscosity changes are amplified through the interaction of the thin boundary layers on the sidewalls, the high shear in the small gap between the wall and the blade and on the rotating flexible blade itself.
