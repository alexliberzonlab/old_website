Eduard has finished his M.Sc. project under supervision of [Dr. Roi Gurka] from the Ben-Gurion University. 

Eduard is working on the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis of turbulent velocity in a wake of sparrows:

Analysis of the images is performed using the open-source Matlab toolbox for PIV analysis - [OpenPIV](www.openpiv.net)

Results are in the form of flow fields, for example, the Reynolds stresses behind a bird seems to show a typical picture of the wake:
