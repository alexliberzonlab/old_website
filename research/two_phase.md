### Where this problem is important?

### What we need to understand

What we do not really know is: 

1.  Coupling between the flow and the solid particle motion: 
    *   one- or two-way coupling? 
    *   what's important beyond the Stokes number? 

This strongly affects our ability to model the two-phase, particulate flows on the computer and be sure that what we model really works. A short introduction from the Wikipedia:[Particle laden flows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-laden_flows)



### How do we study particle laden flows?

We can **duplicate** the [3D-PTV](3dptv.html) system, that captures **500 frames per second (fps)** and stores the digital images for a long time (tens of minutes). We can use another system, for example based on a single high-speed camera of 2000 fps and the four-mirror view splitter (see the work of [Mark Kreizer](../people/mark_kreizer.html)) and take measurements of the liquid phase (our usual flow tracers that diffract a green light) and the solid phase (solid particles of Silica Gel that are roughly 500 micrometers in diameter and have density of 1.4 gr/cm.c.)
