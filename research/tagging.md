#### Pesticide control

Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection is deeply concerned with the illegal, improper and outrageous use of pesticides, hurting birds, wild animals and pets. [Link] 



#### Part of the problem - identification

The part of the problem is that in order to successfully fulfil the law, the ministry has to provide 1:1 identification of the pesticide sources. This problem has not been resolved and lead to our idea. 



#### The idea - electronic tagging

Similar to what's known as a 'bio-marking' principle, we suggest to test if the electronic tagging can be a solution. It's supposedly 1:1 identification (like a barcode), but we still have to find a way to mark pesticides.
