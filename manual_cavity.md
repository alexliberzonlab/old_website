## Manual of operation of a lid-driven cavity motor



1.  from the controller exit five cables red , white , rs232 , and two gray cables to the motor 

2.  in order to use the motor and the controller 

    (**important**-- it must been done in this order)

    *   b) turn on DC power supply ( it must be on 24 v ) 
    *   c) plug the rs232 to David's PC 

1.  Program 
    *   a) click on the shortcut SEPLink ( in middle up of the Desktop ( when program window opens you must click on Done without changing anything )). 
    *   b) program screen is divided into four parts at the upper right window you should see two green lamps connect and online 
    *   c) command window (down left window called Terminal)

         ( _ comes instead of spacebar )
         j_50 ( the wanted rpm can be positive and negative )    
         j_0 in order to stop 
    
:   *   d) relation of the teeth quantity between big and small gear is 36 to 14,

         ![v[m/s]=1.426*10 sqr(-4) * omega [rpm]][1]  
    



##### Lateral mode as a function of angular velocity

Lateral mode is the movement of the belt right/left (in respect to the main direction). David has measured the 10 periods from which we can derive the following result: [Google spreadsheet][2] 

The length of the belt is 103 cm (David, 25.02.10)
